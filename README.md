# Save and Mod Manager for Payday 2

A simple save and mod manager for Payday 2.
This program makes it incredibly fast & easy to swap saves in Payday 2, as well as allowing for mods to be assigned to saves and automatically loaded/unloaded when swapping save.

I made this back in 2017 but just now (June 2021) found the source code for it, I only fixed a few bugs before uploading it here.

### For those worried about losing their saves!
This program **CAN NOT** delete your save, it simply does not have the ability to delete or move your save whatsoever, it can only **rename** when loading or unloading it.
The Save and Mod Manager is 100% safe for your saves. 

### Using the Save and Mod Manager for Payday 2

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/10xJSChad/Payday-2-Save-Manager/releases/latest)
2. Run PaydaySwap.exe, when launching it for the first time, it will prompt you to select your game and save path
3. Run PaydaySwap.exe again, it will prompt you to select a name for your save
4. Done! The Save and Mod Manager is now ready to be used.

#### Creating new saves
To create a new save, copy the extensionless "Clear Save" file that comes with the Save and Mod Manager into your Payday 2 save directory, you can then rename it to whatever you want the same for this save to be (make sure it still has no extension!) and then run PaydaySwap.exe

#### Using existing (not currently loaded) saves
To use an existing, but not currently loaded save with the Save and Mod Manager, simply put it into your Payday 2 save directory and name it whatever you want the name for this save to be (with no extension!) and then run PaydaySwap.exe

#### Assigning mods to be loaded with your saves
To choose which mods should be loaded with your save, you first have to place mods into the Mods directory of the Save and Mod Manager. Mods that are placed in the Payday 2 Mods folder will **ALWAYS** be loaded.
Once your mods are in the Mods directory of the Save and Mod Manager, they will appear when running PaydaySwap.exe.
From then on, you simply select your mod in the program, and click on the arrows to either load or unload it, but **make sure to click the save button for your changes to go into effect**.
